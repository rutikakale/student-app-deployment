# 🎓 Student App - Complete DevOps CI/CD Project 🚀

A **Java-based Student Management Web Application** deployed through a **fully automated CI/CD pipeline** using **Git, GitHub, Jenkins, AWS EC2 (Ubuntu), Maven, and Apache Tomcat**.

This project demonstrates how to automate the **build, test, and deployment** process for Java applications using Jenkins Pipelines and AWS infrastructure.

---

## 🧩 Project Summary

The **Student App** enables users to manage student data — including name, age, qualification, percentage, and passing year — through a simple web interface.

This project focuses on end-to-end automation with **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)**, eliminating manual intervention during deployment.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a **fully automated DevOps pipeline** that:

1. Pulls the latest source code from GitHub when new commits are pushed.  
2. Builds the Java project using Maven to generate a `.war` file.  
3. Automatically deploys the `.war` file to an Apache Tomcat server on AWS EC2.  
4. Restarts the application automatically and makes it live for users.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline Workflow

**Automated Stages:**
1. **Code Checkout:** Jenkins pulls latest code from GitHub.  
2. **Build:** Maven compiles and packages code into a `.war` file.  
3. **Deploy:** Jenkins transfers `.war` to the Tomcat server via SSH.  
4. **Restart:** Tomcat service restarts automatically.  
5. **Verify:** Application is accessible instantly on the browser.

## 🧱 Jenkinsfile Overview

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        SERVER_IP   = '3.110.194.27'
        SSH_CRED_ID = 'node-app-key'
        TOMCAT_PATH = '/var/lib/tomcat10/webapps'
        TOMCAT_SVC  = 'tomcat10'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                echo '📥 Pulling code from GitHub repository...'
                git branch: 'master', url: 'https://github.com/rutikakale/student-app-deployment.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Build WAR File') {
            steps {
                echo '🏗️ Building project using Maven...'
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Tomcat Server') {
            steps {
                echo '🚀 Deploying WAR to EC2 Tomcat Server...'
                sshagent(['node-app-key']) {
                    sh '''
                    scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no target/*.war ubuntu@${SERVER_IP}:${TOMCAT_PATH}
                    ssh ubuntu@${SERVER_IP} 'sudo systemctl restart ${TOMCAT_SVC}'
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo '✅ Deployment successful! Application live on Tomcat server.'
        }
        failure {
            echo '❌ Build failed. Please check console logs for details.'
        }
    }
}
```

## 🧭 CI/CD Flow Summary

1. **Developer pushes code** → GitHub repository.  
2. **Jenkins webhook** triggers automatically.  
3. **Maven** builds and packages the `.war` file.  
4. **Jenkins** securely deploys the `.war` file to Tomcat (EC2).  
5. **Tomcat service** restarts automatically.  
6. Access the app via browser:

```
